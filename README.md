# mersenne-twister

The Mersenne Twister PRNG for Clojure.

This library provides a Clojure-friendly wrapper around the `MersenneTwister`
class from The Apache Commons Mathematics Library:

http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/

This class implements a powerful pseudo-random number generator developed by
Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura during 1996-1997.

This generator features an extremely long period (219937-1) and 623-dimensional
equidistribution up to 32 bits accuracy. The home page for this generator is
located at:

http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html

This generator is described in a paper by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura
in 1998: Mersenne Twister: A 623-Dimensionally Equidistributed Uniform
Pseudo-Random Number Generator, ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer
Simulation, Vol. 8, No. 1, January 1998, pp 3--30

## Usage

```clojure
(ns your.cool.code
  (:require [mersenne-twister.core :as twist]))

(twist/next-boolean) ; get a boolean
(twist/next-float) ; get a float
(twist/next-double) ; get a double
(twist/next-gaussian) ; get a normally distributed double
(twist/next-int) ; get an int
(twist/next-long) ; get a long
;; ... other stuff ...
```

* `new-generator` - Creates a new Mersenne Twister random number generator.
* `generator` - Default generator to use if none is specified.
* `next-boolean` - Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed boolean
  value from this random number generator's sequence.
* `next-double` - Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed double
  value between 0.0 and 1.0 from this random number generator's sequence.
* `next-float` - Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed float
  value between 0.0 and 1.0 from this random number generator's sequence.
* `next-gaussian` - Returns the next pseudorandom, Gaussian (\"normally\")
  distributed double value with mean 0.0 and standard deviation 1.0 from this
  random number generator's sequence.
* `next-int` - Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value
  from this random number generator's sequence.
* `next-long` - Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed long value
  from this random number generator's sequence. All 264 possible long values
  should be produced with (approximately) equal probability.

## TODO 

* ClojureScript support.
